    "1. **Fact Table (fct_messages)**: Contains the measurable events (messages) with foreign keys to dimensions\n",
    "   - message_id: Unique identifier for each message\n",

    "   - view_count, forward_count: Measurable metrics\n",
    "   - has_image: Flag for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimension Tables**:\n",
    "   - dim_channels: Contains channel-specific attributes\n",
    "     - channel_key: Surrogate key\n",
    "     - channel_name, channel_type: Descriptive attributes\n",
    "     - first_post_date, last_post_date: Time-related attributes\n",
    "     - total_posts, avg_views: Aggregated metrics\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - dim_dates: Standard date dimension\n",
    "     - date_key: Surrogate key\n",
    "     - Various date-related attributes (day of week, month, quarter, etc.)\n",
